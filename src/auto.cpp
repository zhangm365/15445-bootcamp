// The C++ auto keyword is a keyword that tells the compiler to infer the type
// of a declared variable via its initialization expression. It can be
// incredibly useful, as it allows for developer efficiency (where the developer
// no longer has to type out long, unruly type names). It is also useful in the
// context of for-each loops. However, using auto poses a risk where the
// developer may not be aware of the types they are using, and therefore at risk
// for buggy and non functional code. So be careful!

// Basic templated class with very long name, to show the usefulness of auto.
template <typename T, typename U> 
class Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz {
public:
  Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz(T instance1, U instance2)
      : instance1_(instance1), instance2_(instance2) {}

  void print() const {
    std::cout << "(" << instance1_ << "," << instance2_ << ")\n";
  }

private:
  T instance1_;
  U instance2_;
};

// Templated function that returns an object of this class with a very long
// name.
template <typename T>
Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<T, T> construct_obj(T instance) {
  return Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<T, T>(instance, instance);
}

int main() {
  // The auto keyword is used to initialize the variable a. Here, the type
  // is inferred to be type int.
  auto a = 1;

  // Here are more examples of using auto to declare basic variables.
  // Depending on the IDE being used, it might say what types a, b, and c
  // are.
  auto b = 3.2;
  auto c = std::string("Hello");

  // auto is not particularly useful for these prior examples. As one can
  // see, typing int a = 1;, float b = 3.2;, and std::string c = "Hello";
  // does not take significant overhead. However, there will definitely
  // be cases where the type name is long and complicated, or when the
  // type name is heavily templated, and using auto may be helpful.
  Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<int, int> obj = construct_obj<int>(2);
  auto obj1 = construct_obj<int>(2);
  obj1.print();

  // Maybe for one line it does not seem all that convenient, but imagine
  // if using a class with a very long name was useful in the code for
  // an extended period of time. Then, I'd imagine it would save a lot of
  // typing time!

  // One important thing to note about the auto keyword is that it 
  // defaults to copying objects, which can lower performance. Take the
  // following example where we construct a int vector, and want to
  // define a variable that is a reference to it.
  std::vector<int> int_values = {1, 2, 3, 4};

  // The following code deep-copies int_values into copy_int_values,
  // since auto infers the type as std::vector<int>, not std::vector<int>&.
  auto copy_int_values = int_values;

  // However, the following code defines ref_int_values, which is a reference
  // to int_values, and therefore does not deep copy the int_values vector.
  auto& ref_int_values = int_values;

  // The auto keyword is also useful for iterating through C++ containers.
  // For instance, let's construct an unordered map with std::string keys
  // and int values, and discuss methods of iterating through it.
  std::unordered_map<std::string, int> map;
  map.insert({{"andy", 445}, {"jignesh", 645}});

  // One method mentioned in unordered_map.cpp was to iterate through
  // a map by using a for loop with an iterator. Compare the readability
  // of the two loops below.
  std::cout << "Printing elements in map...\n";
  for (std::unordered_map<std::string, int>::iterator it = map.begin();
       it != map.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << "(" << it->first << "," << it->second << ")"
              << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  std::cout << "Printing elements in map with auto...\n";
  for (auto it = map.begin(); it != map.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << "(" << it->first << "," << it->second << ")"
              << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  // It is also possible to use the auto keyword to iterate over vectors
  // and sets.
  std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4};
  std::cout << "Printing elements in vector with auto...\n";
  for (const auto& elem : vec) {
    std::cout << elem << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  std::set<int> set;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
    set.insert(i);
  }

  std::cout << "Printing elements in set with auto...\n";
  for (const auto &elem : set) {
    std::cout << elem << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  // Overall, auto is a useful C++ keyword that can be used to write code more
  // efficiently, and to write cleaner and more readable code.
  // Keep in mind that using auto to iterate through C++ containers is better
  // in practice, since it produces more readable code. However, if you're not
  // sure of the types that are being used, it is always okay to revert back
  // to figuring out the type yourself.
