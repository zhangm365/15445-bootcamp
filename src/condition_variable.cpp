 */

// This program shows a small example of the usage of std::condition_variable.
// The std::condition_variable class provides the condition variable
// synchronization primitive. The condition variable primitive allows threads
// to wait until a particular condition before they grab a mutex. It also
// allows other threads to signal waiting threads to alert them that
// the condition may be true. 

// For a more detailed introduction of C style condition variables, see
// https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-cv.pdf.

// This program runs three threads. Two of these threads run a function that
// increments a global count variable by 1, atomically, and notifies the
// waiting thread when the count variable is 2. When the count variable is
// 2, the waiting thread wakes up, acquires the lock, and prints the count
// value.

// Includes the condition variable library header.
#include <condition_variable>
// Includes std::cout (printing) for demo purposes.
#include <iostream>
// Includes the mutex library header.
#include <mutex>
// Includes the thread library header.
#include <thread>

// Defining a global count variable, a mutex, and a condition variable to
// be used by both threads.
volatile int count = 0;
std::mutex m;

// This is the syntax for declaring and default initializing a condition 
// variable.
std::condition_variable cv;

// In this function, a thread increments the count variable by
// 1. It also will notify one waiting thread if the count value is 2.
// It is ran by two of the threads in the main function. 
void add_count_and_notify() {
  std::scoped_lock slk(m);
  count += 1;
  if (count == 2) {
    cv.notify_one();
  }
}

// This function, ran by the waiting thread, waits on the condition 
// count == 2. After that, it grabs the mutex m and executes code in
// the critical section.
// Condition variables need an std::unique_lock object to be constructed.
// std::unique_lock is a type of C++ STL synchronization primitive that
// gives more flexibility and features, including the usage with
// condition variables. Particularly, it is moveable but not copy-constructible
// or copy-assignable.
void waiter_thread() {
  std::unique_lock lk(m);    // std::unique_lock can be used as a RAII-style write lock.
  cv.wait(lk, []{return count == 2;});

  std::cout << "Printing count: " << count << std::endl;
}

// The main method constructs three thread objects and has two of them run the
// add_count_and_notify function in parallel. After these threads are finished
// executing, we print the count value, from the waiter thread, showing that
// both increments, along with the conditional acquisition in the waiter
// thread, worked successfully.
int main() {
  std::thread t1(add_count_and_notify);
  std::thread t2(add_count_and_notify);
  std::thread t3(waiter_thread);
  t1.join();
  t2.join();
  t3.join();
  return 0;
